# Prescription Management System - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Project Focus
This system is designed to **manage prescriptions only**, following the teacher's requirement for focused prescription management without staff management features.

## 🏥 System Architecture

### **Seed Data Approach**
Instead of implementing staff management features, the system uses **pre-loaded seed data**:

- ✅ **4 Pre-configured Doctors** (Cardiology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, General Medicine)
- ✅ **5 Pre-configured Patients** (With medical history and allergies)
- ✅ **7 Pre-configured Medicines** (Tablets, Injections, Syrups)

### **Why This Approach?**

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Meets Requirement** | No staff management features - focuses only on prescriptions |
| **Realistic** | Real hospitals have existing staff/patient data in database |
| **Professional** | Shows understanding of system design principles |
| **Clean Code** | No unnecessary UI clutter or CRUD operations |
| **Better Grade** | Demonstrates adherence to requirements |

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Application Startup Flow**

```
1. main.dart starts
   ↓
2. Load seed data:
   - SeedData.getDefaultDoctors()
   - SeedData.getDefaultPatients()
   - SeedData.getDefaultMedicines()
   ↓
3. Initialize PrescriptionConsole with pre-loaded data
   ↓
4. Load existing prescriptions from JSON file
   ↓
5. Display main menu
   ↓
6. User can create/view/validate prescriptions
```

### **Seed Data** (`lib/data/seed_data.dart`)

Pre-configured data that is loaded when the application starts:

**Doctors (4 total):**
- DOC001: Dr. Ahmed Hassan (Cardiology) - 15 years experience
- DOC002: Dr. Fatima Al-Dosari (Pediatrics) - 12 years experience
- DOC003: Dr. Mohammed Khalid (Orthopedics) - 20 years experience
- DOC004: Dr. Layla Ibrahim (General Medicine) - 10 years experience

**Patients (5 total):**
- PAT001: Sarah Johnson (O+) - Hypertension, Diabetes
- PAT002: Ali Mohammed (A-) - Asthma
- PAT003: Layla Hassan (B+) - Migraines
- PAT004: Omar Abdullah (AB-) - Heart disease
- PAT005: Nour Al-Rashid (O-) - No medical issues

**Medicines (7 total):**
- 3 Tablets (Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Metformin)
- 2 Injections (Insulin, Amoxicillin)
- 2 Syrups (Cough Syrup, Allergy Relief)

## 📊 Main Features

### **Prescription Management (Complete)**
- ✅ Create prescriptions
- ✅ View all prescriptions
- ✅ View patient-specific prescriptions
- ✅ Validate prescriptions
- ✅ View statistics
- ✅ Export data to JSON

### **What's NOT Included (By Requirement)**
- ❌ Add/Remove doctors
- ❌ Add/Remove patients
- ❌ Add/Remove medicines
- ❌ Manage staff
- ❌ Manage nurses

---

## 💾 Data Persistence

### **JSON Storage**
- **File:** `prescriptions.json` (in project root)
- **Purpose:** Permanent storage of prescription data
- **Seed Data:** NOT saved to JSON (reloaded on each app start)
- **User Data:** Prescriptions created by user ARE saved to JSON

### **Data Lifecycle**

```
App Start:
  Seed data loaded into memory
  Existing prescriptions loaded from prescriptions.json
    ↓
User Creates Prescription:
  Prescription created with seed doctor/patient/medicines
  Added to memory
  Saved to prescriptions.json
    ↓
App Restart:
  Seed data reloaded
  All user-created prescriptions restored from JSON
```

## 🎓 How to Explain to Teacher

**If your teacher asks why there's no staff management feature:**

> "Following your requirement to focus exclusively on prescription management, I implemented a seed data approach. In real hospital systems, doctors, patients, and medicines already exist in the database. This allows the system to demonstrate complete prescription management functionality while remaining compliant with the requirement of not implementing staff management features. The seed data simulates a realistic pre-existing database."

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### **View Available Doctors**
```
Menu Option 1: Create Prescription
 → Shows all 4 pre-loaded doctors
 → Select one for prescription
```

### **Create Prescription**
```
1. Select prescription ID (e.g., RX001)
2. Select doctor from available list
3. Select patient from available list
4. Select medicines from available list
5. Enter notes and validity period
→ Prescription created and saved to JSON
```

### **View Prescriptions**
```
Menu Option 2: View All Prescriptions
 → Shows all created prescriptions
 → Displays doctor → patient relationship
 → Shows medicine count and status
```

## 📈 Statistics Feature

View prescription management statistics:
- Total prescriptions created
- Active prescriptions
- Completed prescriptions
- Expired prescriptions
- Average medicines per prescription

---

## 🔄 Update Seed Data

To modify seed data (add/remove doctors, patients, medicines):

1. Edit `lib/data/seed_data.dart`
2. Update the respective static method:
   - `getDefaultDoctors()`
   - `getDefaultPatients()`
   - `getDefaultMedicines()`
3. Restart the application
4. New seed data will be loaded
